# PuzzleGame
Test Libgdx
Sideproject to improve my Java-skills and get to know LibGDX.
Start in January 2024 with the book Java Game Development with LibGDX by Lee Stemkoski.
This is just a first prototype of the game.
Things to do:
- refactoring code
- add multiple puzzles
- randomize puzzle pieces in scrollpane
- add different numbers of total puzzle pieces
- Port to Android ???
